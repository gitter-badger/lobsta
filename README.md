# lobsta
lobsta is a representation of my methodology to a great development experience to create HTML SPAs over a .NET backend to create line-of-business (LOB) applications with a strong focus on development speed, extensibility, modularity, scalability and testability.

lobsta aims to bring a set of proven and open source technologies together in a way that focuses on reducing waste: eliminate boilerplate code and duplications. Those technologies are (front-to-back):
* KnockoutJS, Twitter bootstrap and DurandalJS.  (To be replaced later with Twitter bootstrap and [aurelia.io](http://aurelia.io))
* ASP.Net Web API and SignalR, tailored towards a CQRS architecture
* Entity Framework 6 (To be replaced later with EF7)

_(TODO: what's wrong with nodeJS and no-sql?)_

lobsta is still under development, and always will be. Check our wiki regularly for updates as we prepare for our first production-ready release, planned on May 1st or sooner.
